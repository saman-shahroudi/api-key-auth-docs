## Usage

### 1. Authentication
- **Fedshi Login**: Enter your Fedshi email and password
- Fedshi service must be authenticated before file operations are enabled

### 2. File Operations
- **Fedshi Files**: Download shipment receipts for orders from Fedshi
- **Shipment Pack Upload**: Upload CSV files to create new shipment packs

### 3. Processing
- Select a CSV file containing order IDs
- The tool will automatically:
  - Export shipment receipts from Fedshi
  - Download all documents locally
  - Track failed orders in the list

## API Integration

### Fedshi API
- **Authentication**: API Key + HMAC-SHA256 signature + JWT token
- **Endpoints**: 
  - GraphQL for shipment receipts and pack uploads
  - REST for admin login
- **Features**: Export PDFs, upload shipment packs

## Security

- API keys and secrets are stored in `config.json` (keep this file secure)
- **Important**: Replace placeholder values in `config.json` with your actual credentials
- All API communications use HTTPS
- JWT tokens are managed securely in memory
- No credentials are stored in browser storage
- Never commit real API keys to version control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Failed**: Check credentials in config.json and ensure placeholder values are replaced
2. **CORS Errors**: Use the provided `server.py` script to run locally
3. **File Upload Fails**: Verify Fedshi service is authenticated
4. **Network Errors**: Check internet connection and API endpoints
5. **Port Already in Use**: Try a different port or stop other services
6. **Configuration Errors**: Ensure `config.json` contains valid API keys, not placeholder values

### Debug Mode
Open browser developer tools (F12) to view detailed logs and error messages.

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Update `config.json` with new API endpoints
2. Add new methods to the `FedshiClient` class
3. Update the UI in `index.html`
4. Add corresponding styles in `styles.css`

### Testing
- Use the sample CSV file for testing
- Verify all authentication flows work correctly
- Test file upload and download functionality
